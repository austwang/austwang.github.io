                            A small part of NES Metroid remade with Unity and C#. From the controls of Samus Aran to the layout of Brinstar, these gameplay mechanics and functionalities are recreated as close as possible. A new powerup called the Blocket is also implemented in an alternate level.

                            This game was created in a team of two developers. I contributed to implementing the main movement mechanics and creation of enemies. I also helped add in the game audio and experimented with creating animations, with Samus being the most complicated so far.

                            A prototype 2D game created with Unity and C#. Deploy traversible ziplines to reach the goal. The player is able to see where they can place the zipline and adjust the length and angle accordingly.

                            A fast-paced 2D platformer game created in Unity and C#. Quickly climb and traverse your way through structures to reach the end. Avoiding various obstacles that stand in your way and outrun the approaching rising lava.

                            This game was created in a team of five developers. My contribution is that I helped create much of the UI in the game such as the main menu and pause menu. I also worked on the scoring system and leaderboard system that a player can see at the end of each level.
