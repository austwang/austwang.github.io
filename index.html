</ul>
<p>This project was mainly done in Unity with the C# language for scripts.</p>
<p>I contributed to implementing the main movement mechanics and creation of enemies.</p>
<p>I also helped add in the game audio and experimented with creating animations, with Samus being the most complicated so far.</p>

</ul>
<p>This project was mainly done in Unity with the C# language for scripts.</p>
<p>This is a prototype game where you're able to deploy traversible ziplines. The player is able to see where they can place the zipline, as well as adjusting the length and angle to a certain limit.</p>
