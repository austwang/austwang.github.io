</ul>
<p>This project was mainly done in Unity with the C# language for scripts.</p>
<p>I contributed to implementing the main movement mechanics and creation of enemies.</p>
<p>I also helped add in the game audio and experimented with creating animations, with Samus being the most complicated so far.</p>
