                        <p>This game is a part of Metroid (NES) remade in Unity.</p>
                        <p>This two-person project was mainly done in Unity with the C# language for scripts.</p>
                        <p>I contributed to implementing the main movement mechanics and creation of enemies.</p>
                        <p>I also helped add in the game audio and experimented with creating animations, with Samus being the most complicated so far.</p>

                        <p>This project was mainly done in Unity with the C# language for scripts.</p>
                        <p>This is a prototype 2D game where you're able to deploy traversible ziplines.</p>
                        <p>The player is able to see where they can place the zipline, as well as adjusting its length and angle.</p>

                        <a href="https://laith-tjr.itch.io/just-jump">Just Jump</a>
                        <p>This is a fast-paced 2D platformer game where you must quickly climb your way up levels and avoiding various obstacles both from above and below.</p>
                        <p>This game was created in Unity and C# with a team of five developers.</p>
                        <p>My contribution is that I helped create much of the UI in the game such as the main menu and pause menu.</p>
                        <p>I also worked on the scoring system and leaderboard system that a player can see at the end of each level.</p>
